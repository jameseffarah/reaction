  "description": "This is just your average shaker cup. We’re not promising that it’ll do anything special, and to be honest, after a few months of manhandling, it’s probably going to leak a little. But here’s the thing: this shaker cup was made in America, in fact, it was made in Kingsport, TN at the Tritan® Eastman factory. We bought a batch of these shaker cups from a wholesaler in Ontario, CA and now you’re thinking about purchasing it from our Boise, ID based eCommerce shop. Blue collar manufacturers, white collar businessmen, and whatever collar our happy asses wear worked hard to make, distribute, and sell this piece of plastic that holds your supplements. Then, when you click the purchase button, your friendly brown collared UPS guy will make sure it shows up to your front door. That’s American economy. In addition, 10% of this sale will go to the Wounded Warrior Project because that's where the real sacrifices were made to make this damned piece of plastic. That’s right: we give back to the brave men and women who risk life and limb so that we can enjoy the small luxuries that make civilian life worth living.",
